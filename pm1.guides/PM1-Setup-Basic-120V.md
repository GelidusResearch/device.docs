## PM1 Setup Guide

Our PM1 setup guide offers two methods to add the PM1 to an ESPHome/Home Assistant instance. You can add a new device and flash the firmware with a physical device connection via USB serial or you can add it using the pre-installed PM1 WIFI Captive portal and upload the firmware via OTA. The WIFI Captive portal method is by far a more convenient method since we only need a cell phone to establish your local WIFI connection. If the method chosen is the captive portal then you can install PM1 physically in the power distribution panel and configure it remotely using your phone and ESPHome/Home Assistant after one minute of power on time.

**Important information:**

* If you are not familiar with AC mains safety please consult with or hire an electrician to connect the PM1.
* **Never** connect to a live AC mains supply during the install.
* Use only appropriately rated mains connection wire. e.g. 18 AWG Flexible AC 300V cord (Item ACCORD3 in the store)
* Always use a non-metallic fire safe enclosure to house the PM1. (Item PM1BOX1 or PM1BOX2 in the store or 3D print it yourself)
* Do not install the PM1 on the inside of a metal distribution panel as the WIFI signal will be poor due to the shielding.
* Connect CT1 and the AC mains supply to the same same split phase line. (Higher accuracy)
* If you are connecting the optional secondary voltage isolation transformer be sure to cut JP2 and connect the AC mains side to the alternate split AC line. (Polarity is not critical for the secondary voltage monitor)
* CT1 and CT2 will detect current in or out of the panel, if you observe a negative current during positive usage then you need to reverse the clamp direction.

The ESPhome Home Assistant Add-on is required - see: [https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html)

**Captive portal or Physical USB Serial Method prep:**

1. Open the ESPhome add-on menu and add a new device and enter power-meter-1 or your own convention. The device name must be unique.

2. Skip this step. We need to add a full configuration first.

3. Select the Expressif ESP8266 ESP-12E

4. Skip this step. Note the generated unique key, this must be preserved in the config going forward.

## YAML Edits

* Edit the newly created device named power-meter-1, preserving the api key, add the example PM1 code **after the captive portal line**, as shown.

**Captive Portal Method:**

1. With the PM1 already powered up for at least 1 minute use a phone or other capable device connect to the PM1 default preinstalled captive portal AP SSID named power-meter-10

![Select](../images/pm1/captive.ap.png)

2. Set the SSID and Password.

![Select](../images/pm1/pm1.captive.ssid.png)

After a minute or so visit the PM1 WEB portal using its mDNS address to verify itâ€™s ready. Power cycle it if required.

From your HA ESPHome Dashboard, prepare your edited YAML firmware config by selecting INSTALL on the top right of the ESPHome edit screen.

3. Select wirelessly.
